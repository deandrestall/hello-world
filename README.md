# hello-world
Hello to all!

My name is DeAndre Stallworth. I am currently attending UNLV in hopes to obtain a B.A. in Computer Science.
I am fairly new to programming and completely new to open source projects and websites like this one. I look forward to working together on future projects/collaborations!
